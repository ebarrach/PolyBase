## üìå Project Description

PolyBase is a secure internal platform designed to optimize project coordination, collaborative planning, and operational traceability.  
It offers both a RESTful backend and a structured web interface tailored to technical teams and administrative managers.

The platform enables:

- real-time employee planning and Outlook-style calendar views,
- encoding and monitoring of performed vs. estimated task hours,
- automatic alerts for late tasks, billing overruns, or time excess,
- integrated dashboards for collaborators and project leaders,
- centralized access to documentation and client deliverables,
- secure authentication and role-based navigation through protected pages.

## üß± Code Content

The codebase is composed of the following key components:

- **Database schema**: MySQL 8 structure managed in Docker with automatic import and integrity constraints, including triggers for live updates of overrun hours.
- **Backend services**: FastAPI-based API exposing routes for user accounts, projects, clients, tasks, time tracking (prestations), invoices, calendar planning, and analytical views.
- **Authentication & security**: Login form with 2FA code field (manual), JWT token verification, and session cookie handling for protected page access.
- **Web frontend (Jinja2)**: Modular HTML/CSS/JS templates with themed pages for login, dashboard, agenda, documents, task detail, and error reporting.
- **Monitoring tools**: Project-wise dashboards with statistics on delays, overruns, facturation states, user activity, and integrated document access.
- **UI Style System**: Shared CSS styles (`base.css`, `dashboard.css`, etc.) with unified interaction rules (`base-interactions.css`) and consistent responsive layout.
- **Error handling**: Unified error template (`error.html`) triggered by FastAPI exception handlers (403/404/422) with redirect options.
- **Docker integration**: Containerized development with MySQL volume persistence, automatic schema loading, and exposed API.
