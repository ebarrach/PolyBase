## üìå Project Description

PolyBase is a custom internal web platform designed to optimize project coordination, task management, and data tracking. It includes a RESTful API with role-based access control and a modern web interface for collaborators, managers, and admins.

The platform enables:

- real-time employee scheduling and Outlook-style agenda,
- dynamic task tracking and logging of hours performed,
- generation of billing, alerts, and performance monitoring dashboards,
- structured interaction between technical and administrative workflows.

## üß± Code Content

The codebase is composed of the following key components:

- **Database schema**: MySQL relational schema managed through Docker with automatic SQL injection on container init.
- **Backend services**: FastAPI application exposing REST endpoints for users, projects, tasks, time tracking, billing, planning, and analytics.
- **Role-based access control**: JWT-based login with cookie session and API guards for dashboard, agenda, and restricted endpoints.
- **Frontend (Jinja2)**: Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS interfaces including login, dashboard, calendar, and task board.
- **Monitoring tools**: Admin-level API endpoints for tracking project costs, time overruns, alerts, and billing projections.
- **Docker integration**: Full containerization for both the MySQL database and the API backend.
